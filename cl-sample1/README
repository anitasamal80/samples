###Development Environment Setup
####IDE
You can use either IntelliJ or Eclipse, I prefer IntelliJ for its rich
and easy to use plugins.

Download IntelliJ from https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/

You can refer to the documentation at https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/documentation/

####Version Control

Software development is a collaborative process with a team of people writing code.
As the code evolves, it is important to version the programme files. There are a number of
version control systems used in the industry. Most popular of them is git. 

Github provides an open source version control system based on Git. You can create remote repositories.
Install Git client which provides command line tooling for working with the repository.
Alternatively, you can also use the IDE's integrated tooling for git and other version control systems.

Download and install git
